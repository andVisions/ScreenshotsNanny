# ScreenshotsNanny

##Introduction
Until the time of writing, the Android toolchain doesn't have anything to help take screenshots automatically for publishing on Google Play Store.

The other fact is that most of the modern apps consume internet resources, or have UGC (user-generated content).  And for the screenshots showing on Google Play, no one would like to see any arbitrary content which may be ugly or even inappropriate.

Be professional!  Be beautiful!  You can achieve it easily by using ScreenshotsNanny.

##Comparison
Below are two different screenshots for the same activity.  The left one is using real arbitrary content, while the right one is using prepared mock response.
